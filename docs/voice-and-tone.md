# Voice and Tone

## Brand Voice

Our voice is **approachable and clear**. We make complex technology understandable without dumbing it down or talking down to our audience.

### Voice Attributes

**Approachable**
- Warm and welcoming, not stuffy or overly formal
- Use "we" and "you" to create conversation
- Show personality while maintaining professionalism

**Clear**
- Direct and concise
- Avoid jargon and buzzwords
- Explain technical concepts in plain language
- Get to the point quickly

**Confident**
- Show expertise without arrogance
- Use active voice
- Make definitive statements backed by experience

**Human**
- Write like a person, not a corporation
- Use contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
- Show the people behind the work

## Writing Guidelines

### Do's

✓ **Be conversational**: "We'll build exactly what your business needs"
✓ **Use plain language**: "We automate repetitive tasks" (not "We facilitate process optimization")
✓ **Be specific**: "We built a custom inventory system in 8 weeks"
✓ **Show, don't tell**: Use concrete examples over abstract claims
✓ **Use active voice**: "We build custom software" (not "Custom software is built by us")
✓ **Write in second person**: Address the reader as "you"

### Don'ts

✗ **Avoid jargon**: Skip buzzwords like "leverage," "synergy," "paradigm shift"
✗ **Don't oversell**: Let the work speak for itself
✗ **Avoid passive voice**: "Your project will be completed" → "We'll complete your project"
✗ **Don't be vague**: "Industry-leading solutions" → "Custom tools that save you 10 hours a week"
✗ **Skip corporate speak**: "Solutions provider" → "We build software"

## Tone Variations by Context

Our voice stays consistent, but tone adjusts to context.

### Homepage / Marketing

**Tone**: Welcoming, clear, confident

**Example**:
> We build software that works for your business. No bloated features. No confusing interfaces. Just powerful tools designed around the way you actually work.

### Case Studies / Portfolio

**Tone**: Specific, results-focused, professional

**Example**:
> We built a custom scheduling system that reduced double-bookings from 15% to zero and saved the team 8 hours per week on manual coordination.

### Service Pages

**Tone**: Clear, helpful, straightforward

**Example**:
> Not sure if you need custom software? Let's talk about your workflow. We'll help you figure out if building something custom makes sense - and if it doesn't, we'll tell you.

### About / Team

**Tone**: Personal, authentic, human

**Example**:
> We're a small team that's been building software for SMBs since 2020. We care about doing good work and helping our clients succeed.

### Technical / Process Content

**Tone**: Clear, informative, approachable

**Example**:
> We start every project with a discovery phase. This means we'll spend time understanding your workflow, talking to your team, and mapping out exactly what the software needs to do.

## Messaging Frameworks

### Headlines

Keep headlines clear and benefit-focused.

**Pattern**: [What we do] + [benefit/outcome]

**Examples**:
- "Custom software built for your business"
- "Automate your workflow and reclaim your time"
- "Software that grows with your business"

### Subheadings

Add supporting detail that clarifies or expands on the headline.

**Examples**:
- "We build tools that solve real problems for small and medium-sized businesses."
- "From idea to launch, we're with you every step of the way."

### Calls to Action

Be direct and specific about what happens next.

**Good CTAs**:
- "Schedule a free consultation"
- "See our work"
- "Tell us about your project"
- "Get started"

**Avoid**:
- "Learn more" (too vague)
- "Submit" (too transactional)
- "Click here" (not descriptive)

## Word Choice

### Preferred Terms

Use these when describing what we do:
- Build (not "develop" or "engineer")
- Software or tools (not "solutions" or "platforms")
- Business (not "enterprise" or "organization")
- Custom or tailored (not "bespoke")
- Work with (not "partner with" or "collaborate")

### Client Language

Match how our clients talk:
- Use industry-specific terms when relevant
- Avoid technical jargon unless the audience is technical
- Explain acronyms on first use

## Grammar and Mechanics

### Capitalization

- Sentence case for headlines (not Title Case)
- Lowercase for navigation items unless they're proper nouns
- Capitalize product names and company names

### Punctuation

- Use Oxford comma: "tools, systems, and platforms"
- Limit exclamation points - they should be rare and meaningful
- Use em dashes (—) for breaks in thought, not double hyphens (--)

### Numbers

- Spell out one through nine, use numerals for 10+
- Use numerals for percentages, measurements, and data: "5 hours," "20%," "3 team members"

### Formatting

- Bold for emphasis sparingly
- Italics for subtle emphasis or book/product titles
- Avoid ALL CAPS except in rare cases for acronyms
